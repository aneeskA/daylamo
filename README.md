# daylamo

This tool was born out of a necessity to learn to read Kannada by a Malayali living in Bangalore. Since this Malayali knew Malayalam, it made sense to his lazy bones to (ab)use that advantage. He called it [daylamo](https://daylamo.com) (with a lot of help from his brother).

[daylamo](https://daylamo.com) helps the user to learn to read any Indian language using the one(s) they know already. For example, if you are a Malayali living in Bangalore, it shows Kannada alphabets alongside its equivalent sounding Malayalam alphabet. This, the author has discovered, significantly improves the learning velocity.

Hope this tool helps you too.
